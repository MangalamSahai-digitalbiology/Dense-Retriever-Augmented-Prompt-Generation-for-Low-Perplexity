##Dense Retriever-Augmented Prompt Generation for Low-Perplexity Language Models

• Developed a dense retriever-augmented retrieval system to enhance prompt quality for
large language models (LLMs), enabling generation of lower-perplexity and contextually
grounded outputs.
• Conducted empirical evaluation using prompt generations from Pythia-1.4B, assessing
improvements in relevance and fluency through retrieval-based conditioning.
